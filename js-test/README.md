# Javascript Testing 

    1. install phantom-js
    2. run the Makefile
    3. run `phantomjs.runner.sh jasmine-junit-testrunner.html`


The Makefile just contatenates all the corespring js files into one and all the spec js files into one. So we don't have to keep updating the jasmine-testrunner html file.
