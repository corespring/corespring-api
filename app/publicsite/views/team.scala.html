                        CoreSpring is a team of many based in New York city led by Gwen Baker and Evan Eustace.

                    <h2>Gwen Baker</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gwen comes from a long line of educators and attended public school in the the mean streets of Sudbury, Massachusetts. She got the education bug while attending the Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern University and while working at Andersen Consulting (now Accenture). She made her way to New York city when she started work at Teachscape, Inc. and has worked exclusively on improving public education through her work at New Visions for Public Schools, NewSchools Venture Fund, and as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Bellwether Education Partners. When not working, Gwen is catching up on the news, running up and down the west side highway, and chasing  Maurice the dog, the 7 lb chihuahua who thinks he's a great dane.
                   
                    
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="span5">
                    <h2>Evan Eustace</h2>
                    <p>
                        A transplant to New York from Dublin, Evan Eustace started his career as an audio-engineer doing studio and radio work, and restoring vintage soul and blues recordings for a US record label. But a computer-geek at heart since his teenage years, he was soon drawn into that as a profession. Since then he has spent 17 years developing software in diverse fields including television and publishing, on diverse platforms including server, mobile and desktop. The last 10 years have been spent in education, most recently as CTO at Teachscape where he and Gwen were colleagues. An avid sailor, when not indoors in front of a computer, he can probably be found racing boats in New York harbor, or upside down in a crawl space fixing an engine or replacing a propellor.
