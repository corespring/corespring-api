### Notes

* accessibleCollections in org - will only return collections for a single org - doesn't support nested orgs
* need to join an orgs' access rights to an item when listing it in the cms
  * when read: only can view
  * when clone: can clone, view
  * when write: can edit, clone, view
* new seeding task that uses the services lib? so we can seed in scala instead of using mongo json files.
