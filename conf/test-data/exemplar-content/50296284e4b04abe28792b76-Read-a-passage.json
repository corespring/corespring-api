Their next-door neighbor is an elderly, rich man named Mr. Laurence, who is raising his grandson, Laurie. Beth is very shy and perceives Mr. Laurence to be a grumpy man.</p>\n<b>Beth Finds the Palace Beautiful</b>\n<div class=\"numbered-wrapper\">\n<p>But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not <b>pluck up</b> courage to go to the ‘Mansion of Bliss,’ as Meg called it. She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said “Hey!” so loud, that he frightened her so much her ‘feet chattered on the floor,’ she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there any more, not even for the dear piano. \n</p>\n<p>No persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence’s ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if fascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie’s lessons \nand teachers. And presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March:</p>\n<p>“The boy neglects his music now, and I’m glad of it, for he was getting too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn’t some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma’am?”</p>\n\n<p>Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from \nclapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile. “They needn’t see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I’m shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine o’clock.”</p>\n<p>Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that last \narrangement left nothing to be desired. “Please, tell the young ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why, never mind.” Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way.</p>\n<p>“Oh sir, they do care, very very much!”</p>\n<p>“Are you the musical girl?” he asked, without any startling “Hey!” as he looked down at her very kindly. </p>\n<p>“I’m Beth. I love it dearly, and I’ll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,” she added, fearing to be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.</p>\n<p>“Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day, so come and drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.”</p>\n<p>“How kind you are, sir!”</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note-tip\">www.gutenberg.org</div>\n</cs:tab>\n</cs:tabs>\n\n<hr class=\"element-seperator\"/>\n\n        <choiceInteraction responseIdentifier=\"Q_01\" shuffle=\"false\" maxChoices=\"1\">\n            <prompt>Which statement <b>best</b> summarizes the central idea of the passage?</prompt>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceA\">Beth is not able to learn the piano without assistance.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceB\">Beth wants to practice her music in front of her neighbors.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceC\">Beth wants to try new things to please her family.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceD\">Beth is able to overcome her fear to pursue something she loves.</simpleChoice>\n        </choiceInteraction>\n\n\n    <p >Closely reread this sentence from the passage:\n    <i>“But Beth, though <b>yearning</b> for the grand piano, could not pluck up courage to go to the ‘Mansion of Bliss,’ as Meg called it.”</i></p>\n        <choiceInteraction responseIdentifier=\"Q_02\" shuffle=\"false\" maxChoices=\"1\">\n            <prompt>In this sentence, “yearning” most clearly means</prompt>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceA\">reaching</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceB\">desiring</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceC\">pushing</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceD\">worrying</simpleChoice>\n        </choiceInteraction>\n\n   \n        <p>Closely reread this sentence from the passage:</p>\n        <p><i>“No persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence’s ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters.”</i></p>\n        <choiceInteraction responseIdentifier=\"Q_03\" shuffle=\"false\" maxChoices=\"1\">\n            <prompt>What effect does this sentence provide the reader as the story develops?</prompt>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceA\">The reader believes that what is happening at the house is mysterious.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceB\">The reader remains unaware that Mr. Laurence typically helps his neighbors.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceC\">The reader thinks that Mr. Laurence will not succeed even though he tries.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceD\">The reader understands Mr. Laurence’s intentions even though Beth does not.</simpleChoice>\n        </choiceInteraction>\n   \n    \n        \n        <choiceInteraction responseIdentifier=\"Q_04\" shuffle=\"false\" maxChoices=\"1\">\n            <prompt>Closely reread this line spoken by Mr. Laurence:<p><i>“They needn’t see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time.”</i></p> Why does Mr. Laurence say this to the girls?</prompt>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceA\">He wants them to know he does not like to be disturbed.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceB\">He is trying to create a comfortable situation for Beth.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceC\">He is trying to express the general rules of the mansion.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceD\">He wants them to know they will not be alone in the big mansion.</simpleChoice>\n        </choiceInteraction>\n\n \n</itemBody> \n</assessmentItem>"
