Their next-door neighbor is an \nelderly, rich man named Mr. Laurence, who is raising his grandson, Laurie. Beth is very shy \nand perceives Mr. Laurence to be a grumpy man.</i>\n<h3>Beth Finds the Palace Beautiful</h3>\n<p/>But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not <b>pluck up</b> courage to go to \nthe ‘Mansion of Bliss,’ as Meg called it. She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not \nbeing aware of her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \n“Hey!” so loud, that he frightened her so much her ‘feet chattered on the floor,’ she never \n5 told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there any more, not even \nfor the dear piano. \n<p/>No persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. \nLaurence’s ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the \nbrief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and talked away about great \n10 singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes \nthat Beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if \nfascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her great eyes \nwide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance. Taking no \nmore notice of her than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie’s lessons \n15 and teachers. And presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March:\n<p/>“The boy neglects his music now, and I’m glad of it, for he was getting too fond of it. \nBut the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn’t some of your girls like to run over, and \npractice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma’am?”\n<p/>Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from \n20 clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and the thought of practicing on that \nsplendid instrument quite took her breath away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. \nLaurence went on with an odd little nod and smile. “They needn’t see or speak to anyone, \nbut run in at any time. For I’m shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is \nout a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine o’clock.”\n<p/>Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that last \narrangement left nothing to be desired. “Please, tell the young ladies what I say, and if they \ndon't care to come, why, never mind.” Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked \nup at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way.\n<p/>“Oh sir, they do care, very very much!”\n<p/>“Are you the musical girl?” he asked, without any startling “Hey!” as he looked down \nat her very kindly. \n<p/>“I’m Beth. I love it dearly, and I’ll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me, \nand be disturbed,” she added, fearing to be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she \nspoke.\n<p/>“Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day, so come and drum away as \nmuch as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.”\n<p/>“How kind you are, sir!”\n\n<p align=\"right\">www.gutenberg.org</p>\n\n<center><b>Words that could be defined for students are in bold.</b></center>\n\n\n<br/>\n        <choiceInteraction responseIdentifier=\"Q_01\" shuffle=\"false\" maxChoices=\"1\">\n            <prompt>Which statement <b>best</b> summarizes the central idea of the passage?</prompt>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceA\">Beth is not able to learn the piano without assistance.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceB\">Beth wants to practice her music in front of her neighbors.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceC\">Beth wants to try new things to please her family.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceD\">Beth is able to overcome her fear to pursue something she loves.</simpleChoice>\n        </choiceInteraction>\n\n\n<br/>\n    <p/>Closely reread this sentence from lines 1–2 of the passage:\n    <p/><i>“But Beth, though <b>yearning</b> for the grand piano, could not pluck up courage to go to the ‘Mansion of Bliss,’ as Meg called it.”</i>\n        <choiceInteraction responseIdentifier=\"Q_02\" shuffle=\"false\" maxChoices=\"1\">\n            <prompt>In this sentence, “yearning” most clearly means</prompt>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceA\">reaching</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceB\">desiring</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceC\">pushing</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceD\">worrying</simpleChoice>\n        </choiceInteraction>\n\n<br/>    \n        <p/>Closely reread this sentence from lines 7–8 of the passage:\n        <p/><i>“No persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence’s ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters.”</i>\n        <choiceInteraction responseIdentifier=\"Q_03\" shuffle=\"false\" maxChoices=\"1\">\n            <prompt>What effect does this sentence provide the reader as the story develops?</prompt>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceA\">The reader believes that what is happening at the house is mysterious.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceB\">The reader remains unaware that Mr. Laurence typically helps his neighbors.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceC\">The reader thinks that Mr. Laurence will not succeed even though he tries.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceD\">The reader understands Mr. Laurence’s intentions even though Beth does not.</simpleChoice>\n        </choiceInteraction>\n   \n    \n<br/> \n    <p/>Closely reread this line spoken by Mr. Laurence from lines 22–23 of the passage:\n    <p/><i>“They needn’t see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time.”</i>\n        \n        <choiceInteraction responseIdentifier=\"Q_04\" shuffle=\"false\" maxChoices=\"1\">\n            <prompt>Why does Mr. Laurence say this to the girls?</prompt>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceA\">He wants them to know he does not like to be disturbed.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceB\">He is trying to create a comfortable situation for Beth.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceC\">He is trying to express the general rules of the mansion.</simpleChoice>\n            <simpleChoice identifier=\"ChoiceD\">He wants them to know they will not be alone in the big mansion.</simpleChoice>\n        </choiceInteraction>\n\n \n</itemBody> \n</assessmentItem>"
